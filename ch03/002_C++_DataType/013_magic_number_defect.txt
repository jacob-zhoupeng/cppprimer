for (int index = 0; index < 512; ++index)

Readability: what does 512 mean?
Maintainability: assume your program has 1000 lines, 512 appears 4% of your code,
                 that is 400 lines has 512. and then you have to modify 80% of 512s.
				 how can you do that better?

const: read-only
1. Can you assign const object address to a non-const ptr?
  const double minWage = 9.60;
  double* ptr = &minWage; //! Compile error!
  const double* cptr = &minWage; // OK!

// Const example:
int strcmp(const char* str1, const char* str2);
int strcpy(char* dest, const char* src);

// Const ptr
int errNumb = 0;
int* const curErr = &errNumb;

// Another use of const
const double pi = 3.14159;
const double* const pi_ptr = &pi;
